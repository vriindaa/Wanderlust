**Wanderlust, is a comprehensive full-stack application built on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework.**
It seamlessly integrates various technologies to create a platform for exploring listings in different locations.
**Technologies such as HTML, Bootstrap, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB** were employed to ensure a smooth user experience.

The project allows any user to add and view listings, with the ability for the creator of a listing to edit and delete it. Similarly, users can add reviews to listings, with the same creator-exclusive deletion rights.
One of the standout features of Wanderlust is its mapping functionality, displaying the location of each listing. Furthermore, the project prioritizes security through authorization and authentication implemented via Passport. This ensures that only authenticated users can access and modify listings or reviews. The use of Express sessions enhances the security and user experience of the application.

Overall, Wanderlust was crafted to have an immersive experience of the collaboration of frontend, backend, and database technologies working in unison to deliver a seamless exploration platform.
